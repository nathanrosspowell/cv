LaTeX source for my CV.
Visit the [latest releases][lr] section to view the compiled PDF, this is also hosted on my [website][cv].
I use [TeXworks][tw] under windows to build the PDF file.

Tha latest builds are updated automatically via [Travis CI][ci] thanks to the method layed out by [SimonWaldherr/HowTo-Deploy-LaTeX-Documents/][sw].
